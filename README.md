# Curve Fitter

## Introduction
This is my curve-fitting script that can be used to fit all kinds of curves to a set of 2 variables with error using orthogonal distance regression (ODR).
## Using the script (not residual plot)
Enter the values in the "Data.csv" file, then change the return argument for the function "func" to suit the desired function, and add parameters as necessary (default is 2 parameters and a linear function). Then, change the value of variable "guess" to the intial guess for each fitting parameter (default is "(1,0)").
Then, run the script and it will plot the points with errorbars and the fitted curve.

Enjoy!
